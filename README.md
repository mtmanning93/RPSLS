# Rock.Paper.Scissors.Lizard.Spock

Rock.Paper.Scissors.Lizard.Spock (RPSLS for short) is a fun game played in order to make a decision on something. Usually it involves 2 players, however this online game is played against the computer which selects a choice at random. The original version of 'Rock Paper Scissors' is seen to have too fewer options often presenting a draw. In this game there are 2 extra options 'Lizard Spock' meaning a winner is more likely.

The site is targeted towards both adults and children looking to make a decsion such as "who drives to the restaurant". The game is more commonly known from the cult TV series 'The Big Bang Theory' therefore it is expected that the game would als attract a large number of these users.
